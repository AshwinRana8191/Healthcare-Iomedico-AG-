# Predictive Modeling for Oncology Clinical Trial Success and Efficiency Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies advanced data science techniques to analyze publicly available oncology clinical trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov. The goal is to identify factors associated with trial success and duration, build predictive models for trial outcomes, and develop a reproducible analysis pipeline.

## Objectives
- Identify factors associated with trial success (completion vs. termination) and duration
- Build predictive models for trial outcomes
- Develop a reproducible and efficient analysis pipeline
- Generate insights relevant to optimizing clinical trial design and execution in oncology

## Methodology

### 1. Data Exploration
- Analyze distributions of key variables in oncology trials
- Visualize relationships between features and outcomes
- Identify patterns and trends in trial characteristics

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Create target variables: Trial Status (Binary: Completed vs. Terminated), Trial Duration (Numerical)
- Extract features from structured data
- Apply NLP to text fields (Eligibility Criteria, Intervention Description)
- Handle missing values and standardize formats

### 3. Model Training
- Develop classification models for Trial Status prediction
- Develop regression models for Trial Duration prediction
- Compare performance of multiple algorithms
- Identify the most effective modeling approaches

### 4. Model Evaluation & Insights
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics
- Analyze feature importance and SHAP values
- Visualize model performance and predictions
- Generate actionable insights for trial design optimization

### 5. Pipeline Development & Reproducibility
- Structure code logically
- Use version control
- Encapsulate processing and modeling steps into reproducible pipeline
