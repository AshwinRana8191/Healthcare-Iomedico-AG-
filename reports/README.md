# Clinical Trial Analysis Reports Directory

This directory contains sample reports and visualizations generated from the oncology clinical trial analysis project. The content is organized as follows:

## Main Reports

- `clinical_trial_success_factors_report.md`: Comprehensive analysis of factors influencing oncology clinical trial success, including key findings on trial duration, enrollment efficiency, intervention types, sponsor effects, and biomarker integration. The report includes model performance metrics and actionable recommendations.

## Figures (`/figures`)

Contains visualizations generated from the analysis:

- `trial_success_factors.svg`: Bar chart visualization showing the impact of key factors (trial duration, enrollment efficiency, biomarker integration, and sponsor type) on clinical trial success rates.

- `phase_cancer_type_success.svg`: Comparative visualization of success rates across different cancer types and trial phases, highlighting which combinations have historically shown better outcomes.

- `model_performance_comparison.svg`: Comparison of different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Network, and Ensemble) on key performance metrics (Accuracy, AUC-ROC, and F1-Score).

## Note

These are sample files created for demonstration purposes. In a real project implementation, this directory would contain more detailed reports, interactive visualizations, and possibly additional formats such as PDF reports, interactive dashboards, or presentation materials.

The reports and visualizations are based on the analysis of the sample data found in the `/data` directory. For a complete understanding of the project, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory that show the full analytical process.
